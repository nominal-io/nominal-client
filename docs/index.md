# Nominal Python SDK: Function Reference

The main components of the SDK are:

- An object-oriented client interface (`nominal.core.NominalClient`)
  for interacting with the Nominal platform
- The `nom` CLI for performing common operations from the terminal
- Extensions for working with thirdparty components (`nominal.thirdparty.pandas`, etc.)

Use the navigation bar above to see examples and reference documentation.

If you are new to Nominal and the Python client, we recommend that you read our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.nominal.io/python/quickstart).

Thereafter, navigate to the [API reference manual](./reference/toplevel.md).
