    """Writer for a streaming data source in Nominal.

    Utilizes multiple processes to serialize batches of protobufs, and a thread pool to write to Nominal.

    Use as a context manager to ensure resources are cleaned up.

    Args:
        streaming_connection: The nominal streaming connection to write to.
        max_batch_size: How big the batch can get before writing to Nominal.
        max_wait: How long a batch can exist before being flushed to Nominal.
        max_queue_size: Maximum number of items that can be queued (0 for unlimited).
        write_thread_workers: Number of threads to use for writing to Nominal.
        serialize_process_workers: Number of processes to use for serializing batches of protobufs.
        track_metrics: Whether to publish metrics on latency to nominal channels on the connection
    Example:
        ```python
        connection = client.get_connection(connection_rid)
        with nominal.experimental.stream_v2.create_write_stream(connection) as stream:
            stream.enqueue("temperature", 42.0, timestamp="2021-01-01T00:00:00Z", tags={"thermocouple": "A"})
            stream.enqueue("temperature", 43.0, timestamp="2021-01-01T00:00:00Z", tags={"thermocouple": "B"})
        ```
