# Global Utilities Folder

This folder should contain utilities that are generally usable in a wide variety of generic contexts.
Any utilities that pertain to using the Nominal API (e.g. conjure) should generally be put within `nominal.core._utils`.
In contrast, utilities that are more generic python tools (such as logging / timing tools) belong in this folder.
