# Building and registering extractor images

Everything here runs on your machine, against the platform, via `NominalClient`.

## Dockerfile conventions

The image is an ordinary Docker image whose entrypoint runs your extractor script:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir nominal pandas pyarrow
COPY extract.py /app/extract.py
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/extract.py"]
```

- Install `nominal` (the runtime) plus your format libraries. Pin versions for
  reproducible rebuilds.
- No CMD arguments, no shell wrapper needed — all configuration arrives through the
  environment.
- Keep the image lean (slim base, `--no-cache-dir`): the whole image is uploaded as a
  tarball on every registration.

## Build and save — linux/amd64 is required

Nominal runs extractor images on amd64. On Apple Silicon (or any non-amd64 host) an image
built without `--platform` will fail at runtime on the platform, so always build:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t my-extractor:0.1.0 .
docker save my-extractor:0.1.0 -o my-extractor-0.1.0.tar
```

`register_image` uploads the `docker save` tarball — not a registry reference. There is no
docker push and no external registry involved; Nominal hosts the image in its own registry.

## Create the extractor (once)

```python
from nominal.core import NominalClient

client = NominalClient.from_profile("default")
extractor = client.create_containerized_extractor(
    "My Format Converter",
    description="Parses ACME vX binary telemetry into channels",
)
print(extractor.rid)   # save this; it's the stable handle
```

The extractor is the stable identity users select when ingesting; images come and go
underneath it. Retrieve later with `client.get_containerized_extractor(rid)` or
`client.search_containerized_extractors()`.

## Register an image against it

```python
from nominal.core import (
    FileExtractionInput,
    FileExtractionParameter,
    FileOutputFormat,
)

image = extractor.register_image(
    "my-extractor-0.1.0.tar",
    tag="0.1.0",
    inputs=[
        FileExtractionInput(
            name="Raw file",                    # display name shown to uploaders
            environment_variable="RAW_FILE",    # how your code reads it
            description="ACME logger .bin capture",
            file_suffixes=["bin"],              # accepted suffixes; empty = any file
            required=True,
        ),
    ],
    parameters=[
        FileExtractionParameter(
            name="Quality threshold",
            environment_variable="THRESHOLD",
            description="Drop samples with quality below this value (0-1)",
            required=False,
        ),
    ],
    output_format=FileOutputFormat.MANIFEST,
    default_timestamp_column="time_s",
    default_timestamp_type="epoch_seconds",
)
```

Argument notes:

- **`tag`** — immutable. Registering an already-used tag raises
  `NominalAlreadyExistsError`; version your tags (`0.1.0`, `0.2.0`, ...) and register a
  new one for every code change.
- **`inputs`** — one `FileExtractionInput` per file the container consumes. The
  `environment_variable` is the contract key everywhere: it's how the extractor code reads
  the file (`ctx.input("RAW_FILE")`) and how ingest requests supply it
  (`sources={"RAW_FILE": path}`). `required=True` makes ingest requests fail fast when the
  input is missing; an optional input simply isn't among the run's inputs when omitted.
- **`parameters`** — scalar knobs, delivered as environment-variable strings. Same
  name/env-var duality as inputs, but a weaker `required`: unlike a required input, a
  missing required parameter is not checked before the ingest starts. See `modeling.md` for
  which values belong here rather than in `inputs` or in the image itself.
- **`output_format`** — must match the decorator in the code (`MANIFEST` ↔
  `@manifest_extractor`; `PARQUET`/`CSV`/`AVRO_STREAM` ↔ `@single_file_extractor`).
  Only those four register: the backend can't currently ingest the other proto formats,
  so `register_image` rejects them up-front (`REGISTERABLE_OUTPUT_FORMATS`).
- **`default_timestamp_column` / `default_timestamp_type`** — required. This is the
  image's `default_timestamp_metadata`: the fallback timestamp encoding for outputs that
  don't carry their own, and the last stop in the resolution order (per-output manifest
  metadata → ingest request override → this default). Accepts the full range of types:
  string literals (`"epoch_seconds"`, `"iso_8601"`, ...) or typed forms (`ts.Epoch`,
  `ts.Iso8601`, `ts.Custom(format=...)`, `ts.Relative`). `ts.Relative` is accepted here but
  is almost always wrong as a *default* — its `start` would apply to every future ingest;
  see `modeling.md`.

## Activate the image

Registration attaches the image to the extractor but does not change what runs:

```python
extractor = extractor.set_active_image(image)
```

`set_active_image` polls the image to `READY` before activating (pass
`poll_until_ready=False` to raise immediately if it isn't). This is the atomic switch —
ingests started after this run the new image.

## Image lifecycle

- **Statuses**: `PENDING` (processing) → `READY` or `FAILED`. Current backends return
  images `READY` from `register_image` directly; `image.poll_until_ready()` covers
  asynchronous backends.
- **Upgrade flow**: build new tarball → `register_image(tag="0.2.0", ...)` →
  `set_active_image`. The old image stays registered; roll back by re-activating it.
- **Inspect**: `extractor.search_container_images(tag=..., status=...)` lists images
  registered against this extractor; `client.get_container_image(rid)` fetches one.
  `extractor.active_image` is the currently-active one (or None — ingests fail until one
  is activated).
- **Delete**: `image.delete()` — fails server-side while an extractor references it as
  active.
- **Extractor updates**: `extractor.update(name=..., description=...)`;
  `extractor.archive()` hides it from search and rejects new ingests;
  `extractor.unarchive()` reverses that.

## Contract-change checklist

When a new image version changes the *contract* — not just the code — remember both sides:

- New/renamed input or parameter env vars: update ingest callers' `sources`/`arguments`.
- Output format change (single-file ↔ manifest): change the decorator too; the runtime
  fails at startup if they disagree.
- Timestamp column/type change in outputs: update the registered default (it's per-image,
  so the new registration carries the new default) and any per-output metadata in code.
